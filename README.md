In a perfect world, everyone would understand that you need to type ONLY ONE space after the end of a sentence. Just like this. But not like this.  Or like this!  Got it? Good!

Sadly, we may never live in that utopia. Our social media feeds and inboxes are littered with superfluous double spaces left by writers who still believe in the outmoded rules of 1980s typing class. 

Until the revolution comes and single-spacing is mandated by world law, there is OneSpace.

After you install OneSpace, the extension will use a proprietary Magic Algorithm to scan every website you visit and remove all of the superfluous spaces between sentences.

You can't put a price on the peace of mind this will bring you, but out of the goodness of my heart I am offering this extension free of charge. You are welcome.
